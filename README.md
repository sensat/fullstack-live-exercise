# Live coding exercise - Full Stack

Well done! We loved talking to you and now you're coming over to our offices for the final stages 🙌 

We can't wait to see you but before that, please spend time familiarising yourself with this codebase. In your first on-site session we'll be extending the functionality of this service together. As such the below are instrunctions on how to install the necessary dependencies and run the project.

If you experience any issues please reach out and we'll help you get set up. Alternatively if you cannot bring in your own machine, please let us know and we'll have one of ours ready for this exercise.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

## Folder Structure

- `backend/` — Express server written in TypeScript
- `frontend/` — Angular app for the UI

## Backend Quick Start

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
> [!NOTE]
> The API will run at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Frontend Quick Start

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> [!NOTE]
> The app will run at `http://localhost:4200` and call the backend at `http://localhost:4000`.

## How to Use

2. Start the frontend.
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
